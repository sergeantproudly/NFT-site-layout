						<p>Both geographically and&nbsp;in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;meaning, the&nbsp;Hermitage exhibition The&nbsp;Ethereal Aether is&nbsp;closely linked to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Stock Exchange building created by&nbsp;Jean-François Thomas de&nbsp;Thomon, whose <dfn class="dfn">“cloud world”</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>This&nbsp;is a&nbsp;question of&nbsp;principle for us&nbsp;- to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;exhibition virtual without any physical version.

Moreover, for&nbsp;the&nbsp;time being nobody knows how to&nbsp;do this “correctly”.</span> is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;exhibit the&nbsp;most modern digital works. Art in&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain is&nbsp;directly related to&nbsp;cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;crypto exchanges. Consequently the&nbsp;virtual space of&nbsp;the&nbsp;historical Exchange is&nbsp;the&nbsp;perfect platform to&nbsp;talk about NFTs and&nbsp;cryptography in&nbsp;a&nbsp;historical-philosophical context. We found the&nbsp;name of&nbsp;the&nbsp;exhibition in&nbsp;the&nbsp;poetry of&nbsp;Fyodor Tyutchev, which makes it possible to&nbsp;toy with&nbsp;the&nbsp;word “aether” in&nbsp;its different senses: the&nbsp;original Greek, traditional, physical, and&nbsp;modern cryptocurrency.</p>
						<p>The&nbsp;soul would want to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;star,<br>But&nbsp;not at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time when the&nbsp;luminaries shine<br>From the&nbsp;midnight sky like living eyes,<br>And&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;sleepy world of&nbsp;the&nbsp;earth, —<br><br>But rather in&nbsp;the&nbsp;day when, concealed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;smoke of<br>The scorching rays of&nbsp;the&nbsp;sun,<br>They blaze brightly like gods<br>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;aether, pure and&nbsp;ethereal.<br><1830></p>
						<p>All the&nbsp;works at&nbsp;the&nbsp;exhibition are dedicated to&nbsp;disclosing and&nbsp;explaining the&nbsp;nature of&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain and&nbsp;<dfn class="dfn">NFT</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>The&nbsp;NFT is&nbsp;a&nbsp;decentralised solution where every participant can control their own personal data. The NFT blockchain is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new solution making it possible to&nbsp;exchange personal data in&nbsp;the&nbsp;ecosystem. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;NFT ecosystem, users can share their personal data, while the&nbsp;cryptocurrency to&nbsp;be&nbsp;created by&nbsp;the&nbsp;NFT blockchain will help to&nbsp;ensure the&nbsp;security of&nbsp;each item of&nbsp;information being transmitted by&nbsp;the&nbsp;sender.</span>. The&nbsp;project will launch the&nbsp;creation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;“Celestial Hermitage”&nbsp;- a&nbsp;new museum in&nbsp;the&nbsp;virtual noosphere, which in&nbsp;future will&nbsp;be transformed into&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital branch of&nbsp;the&nbsp;actual museum. The&nbsp;objective of&nbsp;the&nbsp;“Celestial Hermitage” is&nbsp;to&nbsp;preserve, study and&nbsp;supplement our digital cultural heritage: metaobjects from&nbsp;virtual reality, including those initially  existing in&nbsp;digital form (and&nbsp;not&nbsp;simply digitised from the&nbsp;analogue world).</p>
						<p>In spring 2021 a&nbsp;key event happened in&nbsp;the&nbsp;digital art world: Christieʼs auction house sold a&nbsp;work of&nbsp;the&nbsp;artist Beeple Everydays: The&nbsp;First 5000 Days for&nbsp;the&nbsp;record amount of&nbsp;$69.3 million. This work consists of&nbsp;5,000 pictures combined in&nbsp;a&nbsp;10 MB file. The&nbsp;work was bought by&nbsp;the&nbsp;crypto investor MetaKovan from&nbsp;Singapore, who creates virtual spaces. After this transaction, NFTs attracted the&nbsp;interest of&nbsp;major players from the&nbsp;real art market. Critics started contemplating the&nbsp;advantages of&nbsp;the&nbsp;new format, artists began building plans on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;with the&nbsp;new agenda and&nbsp;access the&nbsp;market, while major auction houses&nbsp;- Sothebyʼs, Christieʼs, Phillips&nbsp;- started selling works for&nbsp;cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;exhibiting digital artists, using <dfn class="dfn">drops, collectibles, and&nbsp;editions</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>drop&nbsp;— issue (“release”) of&nbsp;NFTs for&nbsp;sale collectibles&nbsp;— collectible objects (for&nbsp;example, NBA Top Shot basketball cards with&nbsp;the&nbsp;best moments in&nbsp;games) editions&nbsp;— limited NFT series&nbsp;at&nbsp;a fixed price</span>. Summer 2021 was marked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;real NFT boom: disputes would rage every day in&nbsp;the&nbsp;then-popular social network Clubhouse between curators and&nbsp;artists on&nbsp;the&nbsp;future of&nbsp;digital art. <dfn class="dfn">It&nbsp;was then that we decided that the&nbsp;Hermitage should hold an&nbsp;exhibition on&nbsp;this topic.</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>However, nobody knows how everything will actually look.</span></p>
						<p>Digital art based on&nbsp;file exchanges started to&nbsp;develop intensively in&nbsp;the&nbsp;mid-2000s. In&nbsp;2014 one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;pioneers of&nbsp;this trend Kevin McCoy created the&nbsp;world’s first NFT&nbsp;- the&nbsp;work Quantum, a&nbsp;psychedelic opalescent octagon. Artists working with&nbsp;new technologies started thinking of&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;bring digital works to&nbsp;the&nbsp;market, assigning them a&nbsp;price and&nbsp;preserving their uniqueness and&nbsp;authorship: for if a&nbsp;work exists <dfn class="dfn">as&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital copy</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>What is&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital copy and&nbsp;why can’t it&nbsp;be&nbsp;printed? I&nbsp;don’t know if this makes it easier to&nbsp;explain … I&nbsp;always thought that this was related in&nbsp;some way to&nbsp;digits. However, today I&nbsp;realised that even if digits are not&nbsp;printed, that doesn’t mean that they don’t exist! Today, for&nbsp;example, I&nbsp;saw on&nbsp;my hand a&nbsp;code made from&nbsp;digits! I&nbsp;see it every day, but&nbsp;usually forget. And&nbsp;today I&nbsp;realised why digits are&nbsp;not&nbsp;printed. For if a&nbsp;digit is simply a&nbsp;character, then how can it be&nbsp;printed? It has to&nbsp;be enclosed in&nbsp;something.</span>, it may by&nbsp;definition be&nbsp;copied an&nbsp;unlimited number of&nbsp;times.</p>
						<p>When we photograph an&nbsp;image from&nbsp;a&nbsp;canvas using a&nbsp;camera and&nbsp;then try to&nbsp;reproduce it and&nbsp;transfer it to&nbsp;another canvas, we understand that we are&nbsp;not dealing with the&nbsp;original, but instead with a&nbsp;copy. However, if we put a&nbsp;picture online that had been drawn on&nbsp;a&nbsp;computer, it immediately loses its uniqueness, because in&nbsp;digital art each copy is&nbsp;an&nbsp;exact reproduction of&nbsp;the&nbsp;original. How do we make sure that <dfn class="dfn">the&nbsp;file retains the&nbsp;copyright</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>The&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;retaining rights is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important issue for the&nbsp;digitisation process at&nbsp;museums and&nbsp;the&nbsp;structuring of&nbsp;their work experience with&nbsp;NFT. The&nbsp;incident at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2021/7/28/why-museums-should-be-thinking-longer-term-about-nfts" target="_blank">Uffizie Gallery</a> showed that not&nbsp;everything is&nbsp;so&nbsp;straightforward. For the&nbsp;time being, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, if&nbsp;museums make NFT works from&nbsp;their collections, they modify them: they create collaborations with&nbsp;contemporary artists or&nbsp;add the&nbsp;signature of&nbsp;the&nbsp;director of&nbsp;the&nbsp;museum&nbsp;- for example, as in&nbsp;the&nbsp;case of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/ru/blog/421499824684902410/ваш-токен-хранится-в-эрмитаже--уникальные-nft-с-шедеврами-музея-будут-представлены-на-маркетплейсе-binance" target="_blank">Hermitage</a>.</span>, and&nbsp;that its creator receives royalties and&nbsp;can file a&nbsp;claim to&nbsp;retain rights to&nbsp;the&nbsp;work?</p>
						<p>In&nbsp;2014, at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Seven on&nbsp;Seven conference Kevin McCoy and&nbsp;tech entrepreneur Anil Dash presented Monegraph - a&nbsp;blockchain tool which makes it possible to&nbsp;track digital authorship and&nbsp;enable the&nbsp;creators of&nbsp;new works to&nbsp;retain rights to&nbsp;them. Using this system, you can understand where the&nbsp;original digital file is&nbsp;stored and&nbsp;track the&nbsp;transfer of&nbsp;rights to&nbsp;the&nbsp;file from&nbsp;owner to&nbsp;owner. Each NFT object can be “printed” as&nbsp;a&nbsp;unique copy and&nbsp;transmitted to&nbsp;another person, transferring the&nbsp;work from&nbsp;one virtual wallet to&nbsp;another one. NFTs work on&nbsp;the&nbsp;basis of&nbsp;<dfn class="dfn">а&nbsp;smart contract</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>A&nbsp;smart contract is a&nbsp;computer algorithm designated to&nbsp;create, control and&nbsp;provide information on title to&nbsp;something. It is&nbsp;frequently the&nbsp;case that this implies the&nbsp;use of&nbsp;blockchain technology. More narrowly, a&nbsp;smart contract is&nbsp;understood to&nbsp;mean a&nbsp;data set (at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time of&nbsp;the&nbsp;request) located at&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific address in&nbsp;the&nbsp;chain of&nbsp;its blocks. NFT smart contracts were created on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ethereum blockchain in&nbsp;2017.</span> (8) which implies that the&nbsp;artists and&nbsp;the&nbsp;platform receive a&nbsp;specific percentage of&nbsp;each subsequent sale.</p>
						<p>For&nbsp;example, the&nbsp;animation Nyan Cat, which has already been viewed by&nbsp;approximately 200&nbsp;million people on&nbsp;YouTube alone, is a&nbsp;pink cat flying through space, emitting strange sounds and&nbsp;leaving a&nbsp;rainbow trail behind. Nyan Cat <dfn class="dfn">has an&nbsp;author</dfn><span class="comment">@dimitriozerkov<br><br>Michel Foucault’s question on&nbsp;the&nbsp;death of&nbsp;the&nbsp;author is&nbsp;gaining a&nbsp;new relevance, but this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;subject for&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate conversation.</span> (9) who posted a&nbsp;link to&nbsp;the&nbsp;original prototype file online. When the&nbsp;value of&nbsp;this file reached 300&nbsp;ethers (at&nbsp;that time, approximately $750,000), it became clear that this was the&nbsp;start of&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious game.</p>
						<p>How do NFTs change attitudes to&nbsp;contemporary art? Mankind of&nbsp;the&nbsp;21st century more and&nbsp;more frequently does not want or&nbsp;is&nbsp;unable <dfn class="dfn">to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to actual museums</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>A&nbsp;number of&nbsp;artists are still combining the&nbsp;real and&nbsp;virtual so that the&nbsp;collector, when buying the&nbsp;NFT, can obtain something physical&nbsp;- for&nbsp;example, the&nbsp;actual work. It would appear that bridges between the&nbsp;two worlds are still needed and&nbsp;important.</span> or&nbsp;store at&nbsp;home “dusty pictures” which have to&nbsp;be restored, insured, transported, and&nbsp;hung on&nbsp;walls. To&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;physical, analogue art, you need to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;duly furnished storage space and&nbsp;the&nbsp;proper staff. Ownership of&nbsp;non-digital art is&nbsp;causing more and&nbsp;more headaches for&nbsp;today’s owner. At the&nbsp;same time, the&nbsp;NFT format makes it possible to&nbsp;change the&nbsp;status of&nbsp;an&nbsp;object easily. When a&nbsp;collector buys a&nbsp;physical picture at&nbsp;an&nbsp;auction and&nbsp;tells friends, the&nbsp;first thing they do is to&nbsp;show the&nbsp;painting on&nbsp;their smartphone. And&nbsp;then they’re asked: “And&nbsp;where is the&nbsp;actual picture?” The response: “They’re processing and&nbsp;packaging it right now. Then they will bring it over, provided that there are no problems at&nbsp;customs. However, you can look at&nbsp;it right now.” NFT lets you do the&nbsp;same thing; the&nbsp;only difference is that the&nbsp;original picture, which has to go through several stages in&nbsp;the&nbsp;analogue space, <dfn class="dfn">is no longer needed</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;world of&nbsp;digital optimism&nbsp;- yes. At&nbsp;present, however, there are still a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;questions about technologies, safety, and&nbsp;jurisdiction.</span>. You already have the&nbsp;picture&nbsp;– in&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital wallet that can be managed through your smartphone.</p>
						<p>Cryptopunks <dfn class="dfn">are simple</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna:<br><br>Simple, but&nbsp;generative&nbsp;- in&nbsp;other words, created with an&nbsp;algorithm. Generative art is an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;digital art, and&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most popular trends at&nbsp;present&nbsp;- for&nbsp;example, take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;example of&nbsp;the&nbsp;platform <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/" target="_blank">Art Bloсks</a>.</span> pixel-based pictures that the&nbsp;artists from the&nbsp;collective Larva Labs have been creating since June 2017. Recently the&nbsp;price of&nbsp;these files also started rising abruptly. Now some of&nbsp;them cost more than a&nbsp;million dollars. One might think that this is madness. Who is buying them? On&nbsp;the&nbsp;one hand, these are participants in&nbsp;the&nbsp;crypto industry -individuals who made a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money from cryptocurrencies. On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other hand&nbsp;- these are people of&nbsp;the&nbsp;future who live in&nbsp;the&nbsp;digital reality that they access through their smartphones. They have decided that virtual life is&nbsp;far more important than anything else. They are more interested about how they look in&nbsp;social networks than aspects of&nbsp;their physical presence in&nbsp;the&nbsp;analogue world.</p>
						<p>Artefacts dating back to&nbsp;the&nbsp;creation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;contemporary internet are extremely successful. For&nbsp;example, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold the&nbsp;NFT of&nbsp;his first tweet (“just setting up my twttr”) for&nbsp;almost $3&nbsp;million. The&nbsp;same thing recently happened with the&nbsp;original code of&nbsp;the&nbsp;World Wide Web, which was sold as&nbsp;an&nbsp;NFT at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sotheby's auction. It is highly likely that the&nbsp;source codes of&nbsp;social networks, payment and&nbsp;gaming systems, and&nbsp;well-known logos will appear very soon on&nbsp;the&nbsp;market: today all these digital assets are being reinterpreted  as part of&nbsp;modern culture. This is a&nbsp;gradual process: at some point we believed that only great books and&nbsp;great artists would have a&nbsp;certain value and&nbsp;be unique; this was followed by&nbsp;children’s books, then films and&nbsp;video art were also added to&nbsp;the&nbsp;list. Today, the&nbsp;influences of&nbsp;Joseph Beuys, Louise Bourgeois, and&nbsp;Anselm Kiefer, as well as cartoons for adolescents, can be identified in&nbsp;the&nbsp;performances of&nbsp;Kayne West. This means that analogue contemporary art has become definitively part of&nbsp;our flesh and&nbsp;blood. And&nbsp;we are moving further, whether you like it or&nbsp;not.</p>
						<p>Look around you. Cars have stickers with their owners’ social network user names. Their travel around the&nbsp;map of&nbsp;the&nbsp;city has been transformed into a&nbsp;computer “driving game” in&nbsp;real space and&nbsp;time.  After winning the&nbsp;US Open in&nbsp;September 2021, the&nbsp;tennis player Daniil Medvedev fell down on&nbsp;court, stuck his tongue out and&nbsp;started imitating a&nbsp;“dead fish”. Millions watched the&nbsp;live broadcast. “Only legends will understand”, the&nbsp;tennis player explained afterwards. “What I&nbsp;did after the&nbsp;match&nbsp;- this is L2 + left”. On&nbsp;the&nbsp;FIFA computer game on&nbsp;PlayStation, this keyboard combination is used to&nbsp;celebrate a&nbsp;goal scored in&nbsp;cyber football.</p>
						<p>These days it is simpler and&nbsp;quicker to&nbsp;use an&nbsp;online search engine than to&nbsp;access the&nbsp;information in some other way. We have shelved paper-based dictionaries and&nbsp;encyclopaedias, other than the&nbsp;most specialised ones. However, soon they will also be replaced by&nbsp;software. We no longer go to&nbsp;libraries, for we can find almost everything online and&nbsp;instantly see it on&nbsp;our screens at&nbsp;any time, day or night.</p>
						<p>Once the&nbsp;first stage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;valuation of&nbsp;assets and&nbsp;assignment of&nbsp;rights to&nbsp;them had passed, it was the&nbsp;turn of&nbsp;art. We believe that the&nbsp;next development stage in&nbsp;art will involve demand solely for&nbsp;digital creativity in&nbsp;line with the&nbsp;change in&nbsp;generations. New NFT formats, faster and&nbsp;with higher capacity, will appear.</p>
						<p>The&nbsp;artists of&nbsp;the&nbsp;1920s taught us that art lives in&nbsp;every single individual, while the&nbsp;artists of&nbsp;the&nbsp;1960s taught us that everything can be perceived as&nbsp;art. Contemporary people are more and&nbsp;more interested in and&nbsp;want to&nbsp;own objects from their childhood and&nbsp;youth: cartoons, advertising, GIF, memes&nbsp;- everything considered at&nbsp;one time marginal, and&nbsp;then manifestations of&nbsp;culture that were so dear to&nbsp;one’s heart. The&nbsp;things of&nbsp;childhood and&nbsp;youth are remembered forever. Research is now being conducted into advertising clips as&nbsp;a&nbsp;key part of&nbsp;our cultural memory. Mankind holds in&nbsp;reserve numerous fascinating digital assets, which are now more and&nbsp;<dfn class="dfn">more frequently attracting the&nbsp;attention</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>Moreover, approximately 100,000 species of&nbsp;butterfly still exist in&nbsp;the&nbsp;world, each one of&nbsp;which has its own identity.</span> of&nbsp;artists and&nbsp;collectors.</p>
						<p>Interest in&nbsp;digital art intensified during the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic, when millions of&nbsp;people <dfn class="dfn">sat at&nbsp;home for&nbsp;months</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>And&nbsp;on these days we could once again see how our bodies, faces, hands evolve into unique forms which can be considered endlessly.</span> on end and&nbsp;only communicated online. The museums were closed, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;acquiring one’s own virtual collection stopped looking irrelevant. This is exactly when Time magazine identified with the&nbsp;new trend, offering its own cover for&nbsp;sale as&nbsp;an&nbsp;NFT: “Is <dfn class="dfn">Fiat</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>Fiat money (from the&nbsp;Latin fiat, “let it be done”) is a&nbsp;currency whose value is assured by&nbsp;the&nbsp;issuing country (in&nbsp;other words, all modern state currencies are fiat).

And&nbsp;then magic happens: you go into another shop and&nbsp;the&nbsp;prices here are lower than at&nbsp;all the&nbsp;other shops. In&nbsp;my city there is a&nbsp;shop which sells essential goods. You can find everything there. It is called “Everything for everybody”.</span> on&nbsp;the&nbsp;(16) <a href="https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/time-is-fiat-dead-21652" target="_blank">SuperRare</a>. The&nbsp;cover was dedicated to&nbsp;the&nbsp;opposition of&nbsp;cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;traditional money and&nbsp;was a&nbsp;continuation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;series of&nbsp;questions from&nbsp;other Time covers: “Is God Dead?” (1966) and&nbsp;“Is Truth Dead?” (in&nbsp;2017 after the&nbsp;inauguration of&nbsp;Donald Trump).</p>
						<p>Today, when the&nbsp;commotion of&nbsp;the&nbsp;first successes of&nbsp;digital art has abated slightly, this naturally leads to&nbsp;the&nbsp;question: what will happen now to traditional, analogue works of&nbsp;art: paintings, drawings, engravings? Is it really possible that they will no longer be needed and&nbsp;<dfn class="dfn">will be cast onto the&nbsp;scrapyard of&nbsp;history</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>Even if they become obsolete and&nbsp;are cast aside (which is hardly likely), their formats will still appear in&nbsp;digital art and&nbsp;will be described (and&nbsp;inscribed in&nbsp;history?) using the&nbsp;usual concepts: portraits (for example, generative avatars), abstracts, conceptual art, kitsch, NFT performances, etc..</span>? In&nbsp;this context, it is interesting to&nbsp;recall the&nbsp;burning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Banksy work arranged by&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain company Injective Protocol in&nbsp;2021. It paid $95,000 to&nbsp;the&nbsp;New York gallery Taglialatella for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Banksy engraving that mocks collectors spending vast amounts of&nbsp;money on&nbsp;works of&nbsp;art (with the&nbsp;laconic inscription: “I&nbsp;canʼt believe you morons actually buy this shit”). They scanned the&nbsp;work, packaged it in NFT, and&nbsp;publicly burned the&nbsp;paper original, uploading a&nbsp;video recording of&nbsp;this event on&nbsp;YouTube. The&nbsp;NFT with the&nbsp;engraving was offered for sale in a&nbsp;cryptocurrency auction, where it was sold for approximately $400,000&nbsp;- furthermore the&nbsp;price rose precipitately specifically due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;destruction of&nbsp;the&nbsp;physical art work. This incident (an&nbsp;exception to&nbsp;the&nbsp;rule) confirms the&nbsp;hypothesis that analogue and&nbsp;digital art will continue to&nbsp;coexist, but competition between <dfn class="dfn">the&nbsp;two will become more entertaining</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>I&nbsp;understand you, but cannot talk to&nbsp;you. The&nbsp;project is continuing research by&nbsp;participants on&nbsp;the&nbsp;mechanisms for&nbsp;interaction within their own collective body in&nbsp;the&nbsp;digital world.</span>.</p>
						<p>Prior to&nbsp;the&nbsp;stunt with&nbsp;the&nbsp;burning of&nbsp;the&nbsp;engraving, it looked as if Banksy was the&nbsp;main nonconformist artist of&nbsp;our time, who simply spends his time drawing ironic pictures at&nbsp;night on&nbsp;the&nbsp;walls of&nbsp;cities and&nbsp;mocks the&nbsp;contemporary art world. By&nbsp;destroying his work, Injective Protocol effectively repeated Banksy’s own stunt: in&nbsp;2018 his famous Girl with Balloon (2006) was sold at&nbsp;a&nbsp;London auction, but&nbsp;immediately after the&nbsp;sale and&nbsp;the&nbsp;final hammer confirming sale, the&nbsp;work concealed a&nbsp;shredder which shredded half of&nbsp;the&nbsp;work in&nbsp;several seconds. In&nbsp;this way Banksy demonstrated at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time his attitude to&nbsp;the&nbsp;art market. Three years later, also at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sotheby’s auction, the&nbsp;work was sold at&nbsp;a&nbsp;price several times higher. It is worth noting that the arsonist of&nbsp;the&nbsp;engraving from Injective Protocol had a&nbsp;reproduction of&nbsp;Girl with&nbsp;Balloon on&nbsp;his hoody.</p>
						<p>Today some experts believe that the&nbsp;rebel Banksy is simply a&nbsp;participant on&nbsp;the&nbsp;art market like anyone else and&nbsp;is playing by&nbsp;the&nbsp;rules. Will NFT technology manage to&nbsp;overturn these rules in&nbsp;its favour and&nbsp;show that real works will no longer be needed? Is NFT art a&nbsp;revolution that will overthrow the&nbsp;art world, or&nbsp;just another facet of&nbsp;an&nbsp;endlessly inflatable art bubble? We believe that it is the&nbsp;former, but&nbsp;still argue amongst ourselves.</p>
						<p>NFTs are bought and&nbsp;sold on online marketplaces that attract a&nbsp;community of&nbsp;interested artists and&nbsp;collectors. Should NFTs be rapidly manufactured and&nbsp;sold? Or&nbsp;should one hype up the&nbsp;artists making NFTs? Or&nbsp;should one buy stakes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;platforms selling NFTs? Or&nbsp;do business with the&nbsp;exchanges connected to&nbsp;these platforms? Today art dealers like discussing what will happen to&nbsp;analogue art galleries: will they die or&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;the&nbsp;new format?</p>
						<p>Old art was frequently interested in&nbsp;moral issues. Then followers of&nbsp;the&nbsp;avant-garde declared that an&nbsp;artist was by&nbsp;definition amoral: he should act however he wanted. Meanwhile the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;the&nbsp;moralist idea was replaced by&nbsp;the&nbsp;actual art form. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;20th century the&nbsp;cult of&nbsp;the&nbsp;abstract triumphed&nbsp;– one merely has to&nbsp;recall the&nbsp;works of&nbsp;Wassily Kandinsky or&nbsp;Paul Klee. The&nbsp;measured pace of&nbsp;morals was replaced by&nbsp;the&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;movement (see Marinetti’s car flying into a&nbsp;muddy ditch) and&nbsp;the&nbsp;swiftness of&nbsp;decision-making. A&nbsp;work of&nbsp;art was reinterpreted as continuation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;will of&nbsp;the&nbsp;artist or&nbsp;the&nbsp;language of&nbsp;their body: any behaviour by the&nbsp;“author” automatically becomes a&nbsp;work of&nbsp;art. Art stopped being connected to&nbsp;manual work. The&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;the&nbsp;author’s hand, the&nbsp;telling brushstroke&nbsp;– all this gradually began to&nbsp;lose value. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;world of&nbsp;NFT, everything is&nbsp;completely different: <dfn class="dfn">the&nbsp;author “died”</dfn><span class="comment">NN<br><br>Meanwhile his progeny is alive and&nbsp;developing.</span> a&nbsp;long time ago (19); only anonymous characters remain, who receive royalties on&nbsp;anonymous wallets. Morals and&nbsp;form are no longer relevant. Only the&nbsp;fact of&nbsp;ownership and&nbsp;the&nbsp;hype around such ownership are important. The focus is on&nbsp;the&nbsp;person who owns a&nbsp;specific file&nbsp;- for&nbsp;example, take this pointless cat&nbsp;- and&nbsp;one can say: “By the&nbsp;way, this is my cat for a&nbsp;million dollars.”</p>
						<p>A&nbsp;close-fought battle is underway in&nbsp;the&nbsp;art community, and&nbsp;it is not at&nbsp;all clear who will win: the&nbsp;great artists of&nbsp;the&nbsp;20th and&nbsp;21st centuries who are only now discovering the&nbsp;new digital reality and&nbsp;accessing it through the&nbsp;digitisation of&nbsp;their analogue works as&nbsp;NFT&nbsp;- or&nbsp;young, vigorous NFT artists who from the&nbsp;very outset have been working only in&nbsp;digital? Will the&nbsp;democratic market, built on the&nbsp;principle of&nbsp;self-organisation, win out, or will curators with their own programmes? Old galleries with a&nbsp;reputation or completely new sales markets? It is clear to us <dfn class="dfn">that platforms need curators</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>As a&nbsp;curator, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;agree, but the&nbsp;practical uncontrollability of&nbsp;the&nbsp;formation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;NFT market is per se an&nbsp;important component of&nbsp;its philosophy of freedom and&nbsp;global decentralisation, and&nbsp;if this doesn’t happen, then there might not be a&nbsp;revolution on&nbsp;the&nbsp;art market.</span> who will select the&nbsp;NFT works and&nbsp;assemble online exhibitions and&nbsp;auctions from such works.</p>
						<p>The&nbsp;art market is not&nbsp;the&nbsp;only party interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;NFT format: so is show business and&nbsp;big sport. The&nbsp;case of&nbsp;the&nbsp;official marketplace of&nbsp;the&nbsp;National Basketball Association&nbsp;- NBA Top Shot&nbsp;- is indicative. Collectors have always sought out basketball cards with pictures of&nbsp;athletes (collectibles). Now they are being replaced by&nbsp;video cards documenting key moments of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most memorable matches&nbsp;- for&nbsp;example, when NBA star Lebron James threw a&nbsp;three-pointer in the&nbsp;final seconds. The collection is stored in the&nbsp;Top Shot system, where you can register and&nbsp;acquire these video cards. Unlike art sale platforms, this concerns solely the&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;digital objects costing a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hundred thousand dollars.</p>
						<p>Major brands are also expressing an&nbsp;interest in NFT. For example, in 2019 Lоuis Vuitton arranged a&nbsp;collaboration with the&nbsp;gaming company Riot Games: LV’s designers created a&nbsp;branded suitcase carrying the&nbsp;world championship cup in&nbsp;the&nbsp;game “League of Legends”. Recently, Louis Vuitton <dfn class="dfn">launched</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>Similarly, Dolce & Gabbana held an&nbsp;auction for the&nbsp;high fashion collection Collezione Genesi&nbsp;450 consisting of&nbsp;both <a href="https://unxd.com/" target="_blank">physical and&nbsp;digital objects</a>.</span> “Louis the Game”, with some of&nbsp;the&nbsp;NFT prizes created by&nbsp;the&nbsp;artist Beeple. Why then is it important for a&nbsp;fashion house such as&nbsp;LV to&nbsp;be represented in this industry? Its top managers understand that today’s valuables are primarily virtual. It is more important for today’s young people <dfn class="dfn">to own a&nbsp;virtual object</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna<br><br>From this perspective, it is interesting to track the&nbsp;development of&nbsp;digital fashion, when designer clothing becomes important only for the&nbsp;social network feed and&nbsp;can be changed with a&nbsp;single movement.</span> than a&nbsp;real one (22).</p>
						<p>Today big virtual worlds operating on&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain have been created&nbsp;– for example, Decentraland. Here users buy land plots, build houses and&nbsp;decorate them with virtual works of&nbsp;art. They also have <dfn class="dfn">virtual museums</dfn><span class="comment">@digitalmadonna:<br><br>In&nbsp;addition to self-organised spaces, institutions are also entering this virtual space. In&nbsp;March 2020 König Galerie already built a&nbsp;digital copy of its building in collaboration with the&nbsp;artist Manuel Rossner and&nbsp;held the&nbsp;exhibition “The Artist Is Online”, a&nbsp;reference to <a href="https://www.koeniggalerie.com/exhibitions/35679/the-artist-is-online/" target="_blank">Marina Abramović’s “The Artist Is Present’</a>.</span>. These are platforms with significant levels of&nbsp;traffic, recouping costs through the&nbsp;sale of&nbsp;significant amounts of&nbsp;advertising space. Previously a&nbsp;business sought to&nbsp;lay its hands on e-mail accounts and&nbsp;buy up all the&nbsp;domains with its name. Today they are buying square metres on virtual platforms to&nbsp;build shops and&nbsp;boutiques there. Online events are also becoming more and&nbsp;more popular. For example, in April 2020 more than 10 million players watched rapper Travis Scott give a&nbsp;concert in&nbsp;the&nbsp;computer game Fortnite, lasting about 10 minutes. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;real world, so many spectators would not have been able to&nbsp;watch it. And&nbsp;this is only the&nbsp;start.</p>
						<p>We are confident that the&nbsp;area of&nbsp;digital art, NFT in particular, will develop in incredible ways, and&nbsp;that it can look forward to a&nbsp;great future&nbsp;- <dfn class="dfn">safe, smart and&nbsp;fascinating</dfn><span class="comment">NN (reaction of&nbsp;all the&nbsp;neural networks)<br><br>1) So all we have left to&nbsp;say is to&nbsp;wish you further success, good health and&nbsp;fortune!<br><br>2) And&nbsp;now we already lie in darkness in the&nbsp;middle of&nbsp;the&nbsp;room, staring at the&nbsp;screen of&nbsp;the&nbsp;smartphone in a&nbsp;bid to&nbsp;discern something through the&nbsp;grid, and&nbsp;realise that this is not&nbsp;a&nbsp;game. This is our world. It is real and&nbsp;as&nbsp;cold as&nbsp;we ourselves are.<br><br>3) And&nbsp;if you aren’t afraid of&nbsp;travelling meaningfully, then join our company!<br><br>4) However good this technology may be, we advise users to&nbsp;remember simple safety rules.</span>.</p>

					 	<h3>What is an NFT?</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>An&nbsp;NFT is a&nbsp;“non-fungible token”&nbsp;- a&nbsp;digital asset that proves and&nbsp;embodies ownership rights to&nbsp;digital or&nbsp;physical objects, such as works of&nbsp;art, music, video, or&nbsp;even real estate. Tokens are&nbsp;minted onto the&nbsp;blockchain, and&nbsp;this guarantees that each one remains unique. NFT technology virtually excludes the&nbsp;possibility that an&nbsp;object might be counterfeited. The&nbsp;token is stored in&nbsp;the&nbsp;owner’s crypto wallet. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;context of&nbsp;art, an&nbsp;NFT consists of&nbsp;a&nbsp;smart contract on the&nbsp;blockchain, the&nbsp;metadata, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;media, i.e. the&nbsp;actual image, video, etc. The media is most frequently kept in a&nbsp;decentralised storage outside the&nbsp;blockchain and&nbsp;linked through the&nbsp;metadata to&nbsp;the&nbsp;token, but&nbsp;within certain limitations the&nbsp;media can also be stored on&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain.</p>

							<p>The first experiments with NFTs began in&nbsp;2013-2014, with the&nbsp;development of the&nbsp;Bitcoin blockchain (the&nbsp;Colored Coins and&nbsp;Counterparty projects).<br>However, the&nbsp;development of&nbsp;NFTs was more strongly influenced by the&nbsp;Ethereum blockchain and&nbsp;its first full-fledged NFT project: the&nbsp;virtual world Etheria, launched in&nbsp;2015 with a&nbsp;delay of&nbsp;three months.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="toggler"></div>
					</li>

						<h3>How does an NFT work?</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>NFT are frequently bought and&nbsp;sold for cryptocurrency. Like ordinary money, cryptocurrency is fungible: if you exchange one bitcoin for another, you will still have one bitcoin (just like you can exchange any single dollar for another). Since NFTs are unique, they have no equivalent value other than the&nbsp;amount that the&nbsp;market is ready to pay for them.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="toggler"></div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>NFTs and smart contracts</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>A smart contract is a&nbsp;computer algorithm to&nbsp;create, control, and&nbsp;provide information on the&nbsp;ownership of&nbsp;something, including an&nbsp;NFT. They are stored on the&nbsp;blockchain and&nbsp;contain various terms and&nbsp;conditions (for example, the&nbsp;artist’s royalties when the&nbsp;work is resold). NFT smart contracts appeared on the&nbsp;Ethereum blockchain in&nbsp;2017, and&nbsp;to date Ethereum NFTs remain the&nbsp;most popular (but not the&nbsp;only) ones in use.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="toggler"></div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Metadata</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>Metadata is a&nbsp;description of each specific token in&nbsp;text format, which can contain various information: the&nbsp;name, transactions, links to media related to the&nbsp;token, etc. This is public data, and the&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;NFT that helps to&nbsp;determine its authenticity.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="toggler"></div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What to do with the copying of digital art?</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>Copying, sending, and&nbsp;storing images on the&nbsp;Internet is within anyone’s grasp. However, collectors own the&nbsp;“originals” of the&nbsp;works, even though artists may retain copyright. Sometimes this is compared to the&nbsp;purchase of a&nbsp;work with the&nbsp;artist’s signature.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="toggler"></div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How much is the most expensive NFT worth?</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>At the&nbsp;moment, the&nbsp;most expensive NFT is Everydays: The&nbsp;First 5000 Days by the&nbsp;artist Beeple. Vignesh Sundaresan purchased the&nbsp;work for $69.3 million at a&nbsp;Christie’s auction. This work is now one of the&nbsp;hundred most expensive works of art in history.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="toggler"></div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What is NFT art? Can it be called an independent phenomenon?</h3>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>NFT art is digital art that uses blockchain technology. Blockchain lets digital artists solve the&nbsp;problems of cost-free reproduction, since their works are officially tied to specific tokens that confirm ownership. NFT art continues to&nbsp;develop, improving and&nbsp;expanding not&nbsp;only its own ecosystem and&nbsp;aesthetics, but also attracting the&nbsp;attention of more and&nbsp;more interested people. We can say with confidence that non-fungible tokens have firmly occupied their own niche in&nbsp;the&nbsp;art world, and&nbsp;are now an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;it.</p>

					<p>Darkzuu is a digital artist from Saint Petersburg, a designer, and a student at ITMO University. He is the author of the digital series “A Special World”; this series is based on drawings by children with developmental challenges who visit the Yom-Yom Inclusive Centre. Using the language of digital art, the project speaks about children who live full but unusual lives, and are thus in need of support. Half of the proceeds from the sale of A Special World will go to the Yom-Yom Centre. The creation of charitable projects is one of the catalysts for the development of digital art. Darkzuu’s other projects include a series of works created using an ECG machine connected to a heart and generative graphics.</p>

					<p>Jonathan Monaghan is an American artist who works in various media; in many of his projects he addresses the topic of anxiety about rapid technological advances and the cult of consumerism.</p>
					<p>In his work The First and the Last, we see the main triggers of the modern digital world along with images from “old” reality. A stock exchange ticker scrolls across the palatial architecture of a virtual big box store, hinting among other things at FOMO (the fear of missing out), an especially relevant topic these days given the unpredictable growth in value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Subtle references to biblical symbols associated with the Apocalypse are also present. At the same time, the video seems like an advertisement — superficially pleasant, but with a chilling meaning. This work was derived from Monaghan’s 2018 video installation Out of the Abyss.</p>

					<p>Terra0 is an evolving prototype created in 2016, built on the Ethereum blockchain network by a group of developers, theoreticians, and researchers studying the creation of combined ecosystems in the technosphere. The aim of the project is to create more resilient, technologically augmented ecosystems with the assistance of machine learning, the application of automated management systems, and in the final analysis the appearance of “a forest that owns itself”. The creators of terra0 believe that technologies can play a decisive role in creating a stable and environmentally friendly future.</p>
					<p>“Two Degrees” is a three-dimensional image of a forest obtained in 2019 using scanning LiDAR in southern Germany. The work is a warning against the danger of the destruction of the ecosystem, illustrating the direct dependence between global warming and the survival of the forest. As soon as the average increase in temperature on Earth exceeds two degrees (according to NASA data), the token can be “burned” (i.e. withdrawn from circulation) by anyone who wishes to call the smart contract function. Thus, the work may cease to exist, just like the real forest may disappear due to temperature changes.</p>

					<p>Autoglyphs represented an experiment in generative art, each one unique and created by code running on the Ethereum blockchain. A glyph could be created by anyone willing to donate the creation fee of ETH 0.20 ($793) to the 350.org charity. The creator of the glyph will then also become the first owner of the glyph. However, after 512 glyphs were created, the generator shut itself off forever and the glyphs will only be available on the secondary market. For the history of digital art it is important to note that Autoglyphs were the first generative art created on the Ethereum blockchain, where the image is kept together with a smart contract on-chain, i.e. in the blockchain itself. Normally, the blockchain stores only tokens, while the works themselves are located off-chain.</p>

					<p>CryptoPunks was the project to bring Larva Labs into the arena of digital art, turning Matt and John into pioneers of cryptoart. It consists of 10,000 unique, automatically generated portraits, each of which has an owner on the Ethereum blockchain. The majority of the portraits are young men and women with a menacing air to them, but apes, zombies, and even aliens make an appearance. Originally, cryptopunks could be obtained for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Cryptopunks are now well-known, expensive collectible objects, the least expensive of which costs more than $400,000</p>

					<p>Nancy Baker Cahill is a new media artist who examines “power, selfhood, and embodied consciousness” at the intersection of visual art, social justice, and new technologies. Nancy is the founder and artistic director of 4th Wall, a free platform for public augmented reality art.</p>
					<p>Baker Cahill’s series “Contract Killers” is executed in augmented reality and addresses accountability and broken social contracts. The three-part, site-specific project investigates the ephemeral nature of agreements in the environment of digital artists, who are exploited by galleries and auction houses; it also raises the old topic of social inequality. Each of the three works represents hands stretched out to each other in an augmented reality space. However, the handshake can never happen: as soon as finger touches finger, the hands dissipate into pixels. The three sites where the handshakes fail were not chosen at random: each represents a space of obligations and agreement, where trust is regularly betrayed and agreements are breached. One handshake appears before the Los Angeles mayor’s office, another dissolves over a pile of fiat cash, and the third in front of a judicial courthouse. This project also involved collaboration with art attorney Sarah Odenkirk, who innovated a "smarter" contract, one which harnessed the language of mutual obligation and belonging, and Museum Director Hesse McGraw, whose artist- support fund was included as a secondary market beneficiary.</p>

					<p>Krista Kim is a contemporary Canadian artist, the founder of the “Techism Movement”. She is primarily interested in the social impact of the digital world, which she perceives as an independent force subject to its own special laws. Krista believes that the new reality is a watershed moment in the emergence of digital humanism, while the objective of contemporary artists is to proactively implement and participate in the creation of the culture of the future, based on technological innovation and adaptation. Krista strives to connect perception of her art to meditative practices.</p>
					<p>Mars House is the world’s first digital non-fungible token house, created by the artist during the first wave of lockdown in 2020. When designing the interiors, Kim was inspired by Japanese architecture based on minimalism, harmony and Zen. She considers such “therapeutic and meditative design” a natural reaction to current and future shocks. The main effect here is a soft light dispersed uniformly through the space of the crypto house and the amplifying impact of the surrounding dramatic landscape. The soundtrack for the project was written by Jeff Schroeder from the band the Smashing Pumpkins. Krista Kim is currently creating a physical model of a table from Mars House jointly with Berengo Foundation (Venice, Italy).</p>

					<p>Michael Joo is an American-Korean internationally recognized contemporary artist whose works combine multi-layered and frequently disparate elements from our contemporary culture. One topic close to Joo’s heart is human intervention in nature and the forms engendered by such interaction.<br>Danil Krivoruchko, better known as Myshli, is a creative director and digital artist from New York. His works have been displayed in numerous publications on motion design and have won numerous awards at festivals.</p>
					<p>Their collaborative work, Organic Growth: Crystal Reef is the result of research conducted by Joo over a number of years on process-oriented art, crystal forms and collective identity, as well as Krivoruchko’s extensive experience of generative art and the creation of algorithmic content. The project consists of 10,301 “crystal seeds” which grow and transform after each subsequent sale. The development of each crystal depends on the unique identification code of the owner’s crypto wallet and the history of past transactions, resulting in a visual melding of digital data and organic process. Upon 75% participation in the collective crystal reef’s formation, the owners of the crystals become part of a “decentralized autonomous organisation” which also determines the future fate of the project. This will lead to the creation of an ambitiously vast collective work: the sculpture Crystal Reef, assembled from 3D prints of each of the individual crystals from the project. The monumental physical work will be exhibited at venues around the world.</p>
					<p>For The Ethereal Aether, Joo and Krivoruchko represent their currently ongoing NFT project with two works. The first is a three-dimensionally rendered version of a crystal from the collection that is fully functional as an AR ready digital entity.  The second work is a series of seven renders charting all stages of an actual crystal #3226 from the collection that has been grown through the wallet transactions of Joo, Krivoruchko and the Snark.Art team. As such, it is a microcosm of group interaction and portraiture especially designated for the Hermitage exhibition</p>

					<p>Tommy Hartung is a media artist, currently living in New York. In his video clips, Hartung analyses the creation and dissemination of cultural narratives. Through sculpture and video, the artist addresses a wide range of topics, from the Bible to the history of colonialism, seeking to resolve acute issues through flows of consciousness and imagination. Hartung uses stop-motion animation, videos that he produces himself, and found frames. He builds all the sets in a studio, using bits and pieces.</p>
					<p>Tommy Hartung’s feature-length video artwork “The Old Testament” is comprised of 25 chapters that are each unique works of video art. These chapters are vignettes that each tell a story, but together weave a larger narrative about humanity, surveillance, and belief systems, whether religious, social or political. The Old Testament expands on Hartung’s work “The Bible” (2014) and represents an example of a collective ownership model for a work of art where the collectors of the individual chapters can reassemble the video in its entirety through the blockchain technology</p>

					<p>Mat Collishaw is a British artist, photographer, sculptor and director. In his works he brings together the aesthetics of repulsion and attraction, balancing between poetic romanticism and murky elusiveness. He frequently uses striking visual gambits that combine the concepts of seduction, destruction, and ephemeral mirage.</p>
					<p>In his work Eidolon, Mat Collishaw sets in motion the process of dividing up meanings through a series of latent or express references to the art of past centuries. A metaphorical representation of the apotheosis of death is moderated by the brightness of the image of a burning flower. The dark background hearkens to the art of the Caravaggisti, while the brutality of the moment recalls the heightened pathos of images of saintly martyrdom in the works of the Old Masters. The image acquires a quasi-mystical aura, which is only intensified by the additional musical accompaniment<br><br><br><br></p>

					<p>Eve Sussman is an American artist and director. Her video projects often expand the boundaries of cinematic experience, compelling viewers to proactively participate in imagining the subject.</p>
					<p>The work presented in this virtual exhibition is based on Sussman’s revowned video, 89 Seconds at Alcázar, that took Diego Velázquez’s Las Meninas as a jumping off point. 89 Seconds at Alcázar, is an invention of the actions leading up to and following the moment depicted in the painting.</p>
					<p>In 89 Seconds Atomized, Sussman's original video 89 Seconds at Alcázar has been shattered into 2,304 unique “atoms”, turning it into a new artwork, secured on the blockchain. Each token (or atom) contains a 400 pixel moving image fragment of the original video. Collectors who acquire individual atoms, receive a unique token on the Ethereum blockchain. 89 Seconds Atomized prompts an experiment with ownership and collective interaction: the work can be reassembled by atom owners loaning their atoms. Collectors can sell and lend atoms, or request them from the community for public or private showings.</p>

					<p>The project Eva — A Mitochondrial Story arose from the idea of representing human DNA in an artistic way. The creators believe that the more than 3.2 billion variable connections in DNA make us similar to amazing, programmable machines. These machines also write code, resulting in the emergence of a work of art: man, machine, and nature merge into a unified whole. The name of the project refers to “mitochondrial Eve”, the hypothetical maternal ancestor of all people alive today.</p>
					<p>The Eva project consists of a multi-layered video: background, a broken line, head, sculpture and audio. All five elements are generated or processed by the computer on the basis of DNA data. The authors manipulate the initial data, editing and altering the digital files to generate visual glitches. This glitch effect, one of the most widespread modalities in creating NFT works, corresponds to mutations in the human genetic code.</p>

					<p>In 1917 Marcel Duchamp submitted a sculpture entitled Fountain to a New York exhibition. Even though the sculpture, a porcelain urinal signed R. Mutt, wasn’t displayed, it spawned a significant discussion among artists, collectors, and curators about what can and can’t be considered art.</p>
					<p>The project by American video artist and director Marco Brambilla takes as its foundation the ideas of the creators of readymades, which subverted the fundamental principles of art by asking the question “what does it mean to be an artist?” One hundred years after Duchamp, cryptocurrencies and NFTs provide a new lens through which to continue this dialogue about recognition and authorship. In 1985 Jeff Koons presented the first American readymade One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank. This project became a metaphor of the symbol of opportunities for the African-American working class.<br>In the work Partial Equilibrium, Marco Brambilla appropriates, interrogates, and recontextualises Koons’s work. An octopus, symbol of destruction in Norse and Greek mythologies, completely engulfs the original sculpture, disrupting the fragile equilibrium of the basketball in the tank and thereby creating a new form of art.</p>

					<p>Quantum is one of history’s first tokenised works of art, created long before the surge in interest in NFTs.</p>
					<p>On 2 May 2014, artist Kevin McCoy, in conjunction with programmer Anil Dash, issued this token on the Namecoin blockchain. It used a special system that allows digital artists to sell, track, and obtain ownership rights to their works, without additional references or confirmation of authorship.</p>
					<p>As the artist himself explains, Quantum was literally created from code, being an “autonomous work of art written in the blockchain”. The authors subsequently re-created the work on the Ethereum blockchain for auction at Sotheby’s. The auction house described the token as a progressive work that can rightfully be compared with Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907) or Kasimir Malevich’s Black Square (1915). Each of these works was a tipping point for their time, setting major artistic movements in motion.</p>
					<p>Quantum is a continuous, abstract cycle of birth and death. This is a project about creation and about the main principles of a new decentralised technology. Quantum expands and contracts, similar to the block chain network itself, occupying now more, now less space, seeking to define its place in the world.</p>

					<p>The work Hack of a Bear was created in support of the Christie’s auction where Leonardo da Vinci’s drawing Head of a Bear was offered for sale. By moving the cursor in the Aria AR app, you can turn the bear’s head around, ruffle its fur, and open its maw.</p>
					<p>Hackatao’s artistic dialogue with Leonardo’s masterpiece is built on the concept of creating a continuous array of graphic elements — a continuous range of view is created using curves and geometric figures. Each part is visually inseparable from the whole, creating the effect of eternity of the movement of art.</p>
					<p>Hackatao is the creative duet of Milan artists Nadia Squarci and Sergio Scalet. Hackatao’s works are often linked to current social and environmental problems, and also refer back to the history of art, symbolism, and psychology. The name Hackatao originated from the combination of the word “hack” and the Chinese philosophical concept of “tao”, meaning the path or way of all things.</p>

					<p>Simon Denny is one of the pioneering investigators of the blockchain. In his works, he focuses first and foremost on the aesthetics and values that stand behind modern technologies, and also the people and organizations that produce them.</p>
					<p>His work NFT Mine Offset: Ethereum recasts each token as an automated mining unit — a crypto miner- using second-hand Ethereum mining computers that the artist purchased on eBay. To create the project Denny worked with a computer gaming illustrator to render detailed 3D portraits of these miners. Following the release of the images as NFTs, Denny will retire the mining computers from the Ethereum network altogether. Instead of the hardware using the energy typically required to host the NFT collectibles, the processing power from these machines’ GPUs will be donated to Oxford University for environmental research and climate change analysis via the non-profit project climateprediction.net. In this way, the artist will compensate for the adverse impact of his work, harking to the carbon offset programs of many NFT companies. His work is a poetic transformation — moving energy, matter, likenesses, and attention from one network of values to another.</p>

					<p>CyberCrack is not only a work of contemporary art, but also a potential means of moving about the metaverse. The name makes an ironic reference to Elon Musk’s electric Cybertruck pickup. When unveiling the truck in Los Angeles on 21 November 2019, Musk accidentally damaged the prototype’s window when attempting to show off its impact resistance.</p>
					<p>As a token, CyberCrack includes a 3D model and video with an all-terrain vehicle moving about the surface of Mars. The CyberCars team has also developed a mobile app, in which owners of NFT automobiles can interact with them in the garage, project them onto a surface using augmented reality, and participate in races.</p>

					<p>The space in which OLEA 1/10 originated is a hybrid project of Soliman López, a Spanish media artist and the founder of Harddiskmuseu, which exists both in real space and virtually.</p>
					<p>A smart contract was created on the Ethereum blockchain for the OLEA cryptocurrency. Through various mathematical processing stages, the code of the contract was converted into a DNA sample and then introduced into molecules of olive oil. As a result, the qualities of the olive oil became linked to the molecular synthesis of the code, launching the process of creating a cryptocurrency.</p>
					<p>OLEA is a reflection on the rapprochement of species, concepts, economies, types of societies, and information flows that converge on a single substance — olive oil. “Liquid gold”, the gift of the gods, a symbol of plenty and health — in the author’s opinion, olive oil is the ideal form for exploring and perceiving a new nature.</p>
					<p>From the perspective of ethics, this is a challenging work that opens up space for investigation and dialogue around the “revolution of the species” and the combination of the organic with the artificial, the digital with the analogue.</p>

					<p>The main technique used in Claudia Hart’s projects is the 3D modelling of images from the real world, and the creation of digital trompe l’œil. In her works, Hart uses low-resolution polygonal models (frequently used in online games), and then generates high-resolution files from them. For this series, Hart started with a photograph taken in the Hermitage at the time of the Siege of Leningrad. In other projects, the artist creates allusions to the works of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, executing them in a similar technique of computer game modelling.</p>

					<p>Crypto Kitties is the first game on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created by the Axiom Zen studio in 2017. The rules of the game are written in a smart contract: players can buy, sell, collect, and raise virtual cats. The unique DNA of each cat combines the DNA of the parents, as well as random mutations — through certain attributes this sets their external appearance. The rarer and more unusual the cats, the more valuable they are for players. Crypto Kitties played an important role in popularising and developing the Ethereum blockchain, the idea of collecting digital objects, and the development of NFTs.</p>
					<p>One of the rarest tokens is Schrödinger’s Cat. Its biography contains the following message:</p>
					<p>“Hello, I’m Schrödinger’s Cat, a Kitty wrapped in an enigma cloaked in a purradox. Like most cats, I enjoy playing around in boxes. Mine just happens to be quantum. I would love to snuggle with you, but I’m a little busy testing the very fabric of reality.”</p>

					<p>Petridish is a video from a series of works exploring biopolitics, related technologies and their influence on humanity and identity. It presents the landscape of cultivated bacteria in mutation, a picturesque animation of growth and expansion — dangerous and seductive — which explodes beyond the limits of the dish. In the work we can see a visual metaphor for the essence of the way NFTs and neural networks operate, which can break down barriers and capture all around them.</p>
					<p>Shua Lea Cheang is a Taiwanese-American artist and film director, working with net art, participatory multi-player performance, video art, and installations. One of Cheang’s most recent and extraordinary commissions is the solo exhibition 3x3x6 for the 58th Venice Biennale (2019), where the artist represented Taiwan. In this commission she transformed the Taiwanese Pavilion into a high-tech surveillance system, proposing that visitors contemplate how communication and surveillance technologies are affecting human identities.</p>

					<p>The name of this NFT project speaks for itself. The artist explores digital art from the standpoint of novel property rights: each new owner must indicate the price at which they are prepared to sell the work. The main requirement on the owner is that they must pay the artist a royalty of 5% per annum  of the current price of sale. Thanks to this uninterrupted auction, the artist may receive consistent revenues from their work. If the owner doesn’t pay this “subscription fee”, the work is confiscated.</p>
					<p>The goal of the project is to conduct an experiment to show that the artist can always earn a return on the art that they create, and also be sure that the person who owns the work doesn’t hold onto it forever. Questions that the author raises include: does this digital system of ownership of a work of art change the relation between the collector and the artist? Does the new means of patronage increase the artist’s income? Does this system ensure a more sustainable financing of artists’ projects?</p>
					<p>Simon de la Rouviere, the author of the project, is a blockchain enthusiast and programmer from Cape Town. This version of the project was first launched on 21 March 2019 on the Ethereum blockchain. It was damaged, and underwent digital restoration, but the damaged canvas is still included in the current version.</p>

					<p>The British artist Mr Doodle (Sam Cox) defines his style as “graffiti spaghetti”. His characters and lines blend into a single pattern and encompass everything in their path, leaving the boundaries of the canvas behind. The artist took the name Mr. Doodle from a teacher when he was a student, due to his clothes that were covered with his trademark images. Mr. Doodle continues to wear clothes with hand-drawn images to this day, expanding his personal mythology.</p>
					<p>In 2021, in conjunction with the Pearl Lam gallery and the SuperRare platform, Mr Doodle released the NFT project The Living Doodle, which shows a new side to the artist’s universe of characters. At first, just a few characters come alive on the canvas; then, like a stretch of dominoes being knocked down, the action kicks off and characters begin to interact with each other in a fun way, or attempt to run off the canvas. The first collector also received an analogue copy of The Living Doodle.</p>

					<p>Пространство зарождения OLEA 1/10 — это гибридный проект Солимана Лопеса, испанского медиахудожника и основателя Harddiskmuseu: он существует и реально, и виртуально.</p>
					<p>На блокчейне Ethereum был создан смарт-контракт на криптовалюту OLEA. Код контракта через несколько стадий математической обработки преобразовали в образец ДНК и затем ввели в молекулы оливкового масла. В результате свойства оливкового масла оказались связаны с молекулярным синтезом кода, запускающего процесс создания криптовалюты.</p>
					<p>OLEA — это размышление о сближении видов, концепций, экономик, типов обществ и информационных потоков, которые могут слиться в единой субстанции — оливковом масле. «Жидкое золото», дар богов, символ изобилия и здоровья — оливковое масло, по мнению автора, является идеальной формой для исследования и восприятия новой природы.</p>
					<p>С точки зрения этики это спорная работа, которая открывает пространство для исследования и диалога вокруг «революции видов» и сочетания органического и искусственного, цифрового и аналогового.</p>

					<p>Chinese artist Zhang Huan and Kazimir Malevich and his “Black Square” (from the collection of the State Hermitage Museum).</p>
					<p>Ash Square was created specifically for the exhibition and is one of the artist’s first NFT projects. In the video, the ashes create and destroy the grey composition. As can be seen in his other projects, the ashes were collected from censers in China’s temples and symbolise happiness, a benediction, and the sensory memory of collective worship for the artist.<br>Zhang Huan became extremely popular after his high-profile performances in China and the USA. In the mid 2000s the artist created figurative works using unique technology: he devised most of his large-scale works with ashes from Buddist temple incense. In 2020, an exhibition of his works “Zhang Huan. In the Ashes of History” was held at the State Hermitage Museum.</p>

					<p>Rafaël Rozendaal is a Dutch-Brazilian artist who lives and works in New York. He is one of the pioneers of net art, the creator of the popular exhibition concept BYOB (Bring Your Own Beamer), in which anyone can organise a media art exhibition without a particular budget. Rozendaal was also one of the first to create and sell websites as pieces of art (collectors own the domain name, while the site itself remains publicly accessible).</p>
					<p>Endless Nameless is an exploration of composition. We start with a square; the square is divided into sections, and the sections are filled with various colours. More than 1,000 tokens have been issued in the series. After the auction, under a condition written into the smart contract, 50% of the proceeds went to Rhizome, one of the most important digital art development projects.</p>

					<p>Erick Calderon  is an American artist and founder of the Art Blocks platform, the world’s first platform dedicated to decentralised generative art with a curatorial approach. Each work is generated randomly by an algorithm plugged into the platform and established by the artist. The creation of the tokens is initiated by their first buyers. As a result, a buyer only gets to view the work of art after making the purchase.</p>
					<p>Chromie Squiggle is  Erick Calderon’s only project on the platform and the largest on Art Blocks: out of 10,000 tokens, 9,219 were issued. This is when the algorithm was paused.  Erick  was inspired by colour in general and suggests that we view the tokens as simple and easily identifiable forms. A squiggle “embodies the soul of the Art Blocks platform” and may be perceived as the personal signature of the artist, developer, and inventor.</p>

					<p>“Little boxes on the hillsides, child” is a series of abstract suburban cityscapes powered by a program designed and developed by LIA.</p>
					<p>Over the 25 years of her artistic career, LIA's working process has typically involved as much intuition as engineering skills. This is a conversation between the artist’s own fluid concepts and the formal precision required of software code. When accidents or bugs appear, the artist treats them as part of this conversation and incorporates them in the final work.</p>
					<p>Taking inspiration from the song “Little Boxes” by Malvina Reynolds, this work is a contemplation of houses and cities. The cyclical relationship between the construction of homes, the lands and environments they have replaced, and the ecosystems that will eventually replace them is echoed through an infinite production of geometric compositions.</p>
					<p>“Little boxes on the hillsides, child” is the successor of the series “Little boxes on the hillsides, mother”, presented in the exhibition “Synthetic Imagination” at bitforms gallery San Francisco in 2021. The NFTs minted on Art Blocks are the children of the “mother” work and an artefact of the mother program's generative output.</p>

					<p>Sun Signals consists of 1,010 works by conceptual artist Kevin Abosch, informed by analysing and training deep-learning algorithms on sun cycles and solar radiation on Earth. Sun Signals are generated using the artist's solar-powered computer servers. The images and metadata are stored on Arweave's Permaweb.</p>
					<p>The work is simultaneously a celebration and eulogy of the star that powers all life processes on Earth, as well as a reminder to us of the lethal spectre of climate change precipitated by industry.</p>

He has created projects that are important to the development and popularisation of NFTs: Forever Rose (2018) and IAMACOIN (2018). Abosch's work addresses the nature of identity and value, by posing ontological questions and responding to sociologic dilemmas.</p>

					<p>Luuvia Tempra is a portrait drawn by AI, and one of the first significant tokenised works by Robness.</p>
					<p>Robness is an American digital artist, a pioneer and populariser of NFTs. In 2016 he participated in the creation of one of the earliest, now historic NFT projects – the Rare Pepes cards, made using the image of the popular Internet meme Pepe the Frog.</p>
					<p>Robness is also one of the main NFT artist-provocateurs. In 2019, using the SuperRare platform, he tokenised an animated GIF made from a photo of a trash can from stock footage of the shop, with glitch effects added using the PhotoMosh app (the 64 GALLON TOTER). Due to fear of copyright-related litigation, the founders of SuperRare decided to delete the NFT from the platform. As theon of the  first work withdrawn from the platform, it became even more valuable and caused a wave of support for Robness. In another recent project he “burned” (sent to the universally inaccessible blockchain address) CryptoPunk #2317. He documented this act by creating a series of images of the CryptoPunk with burn marks and dedicated it to the Trash Art Movement – a genre of crypt art that uses existing media to create new works</p>

					<p>Robert Wilson is an American artist and film director known for his experimental theatre pieces.</p>
					<p>The video work GAGA/MARAT is a restaging of French painter Jacques-Louis David’s famous 1793 work The Death of Marat. After viewing the painting in the Louvre and learning that it was one of several official versions by David’s studio, Wilson was inspired to explore the concept of authenticity. American pop artist Lady Gaga posed as Marat and voiced an accompanying audio score based on the erotic writings of the Marquis de Sade. The original video La Mort de Marat serving as the basis for the NFT is one of a series of portraits created by Wilson where Lady Gaga poses as portrait subjects from the Louvre’s collection. As well as recreating Jacques-Louis David’s work, Lady Gaga also inhabited images from the Portrait of Mademoiselle Rivière by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1806) and Andrea Solari’s Head of Saint John the Baptist (1507).<br><br><br></p>
